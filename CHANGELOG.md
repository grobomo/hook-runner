# Changelog

All notable changes to hook-runner are documented here.

## [2.15.1] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Spec-gate subtask detection** (T363) — when a branch references T331, the gate now also checks for unchecked subtasks (T331a-T331z) in `specs/*/tasks.md`. Previously, marking the parent task `[x]` would block all further pushes on that branch even with open subtasks. 2 new tests.
- **DRY** (T362) — replaced deprecated `url.parse()` with `new URL()` in self-reflection.js, extracted brain host/port to module-level constants.

## [2.15.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Brain bridge** (T331) — self-reflection.js now tries unified-brain `/ask` endpoint first for LLM analysis (fast, has three-tier memory). Falls back to direct LLM subprocess when brain is unavailable. Analysis source (`brain` vs `claude-p`) logged in reflection output and session summaries.
- `isBrainAvailable()` — health check with 2s timeout, cached per invocation.
- `callBrain()` — POST `/ask` with structured reflection payload (question, source, channel, metadata).
- `analyze()` — orchestrator: brain-first with automatic fallback.
- `BRAIN_URL` env var for configuring brain endpoint (default `http://localhost:8790`).
- **Test suite** — `test-T331-brain-bridge.sh` (8 tests: mock brain, fallback, payload validation).

## [2.14.6] — 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **DRY** (T361) — extracted shared `isPidRunning` into `_is-pid-running.js` helper. Underscore prefix convention: `_helper.js` files are utilities skipped by `load-modules.js` and `test-modules.sh`.

## [2.14.5] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **Session collision detector** (T351) — SessionStart module warns when multiple Claude Code sessions are active on the same project. Writes lock file per project+PID, detects active sessions, warns with PIDs and branches. Prevents context-reset tab proliferation chaos.
- **Session cleanup** updated to sweep stale session-lock files from crashed sessions.
- **Test suite** — `test-T351-session-collision.sh` (8 tests).

## [2.14.4] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **README.md** — updated workflow table (10 → 5 workflows with accurate module counts after T313 consolidation), added `--integrity` and `--report --analyze` to CLI reference, removed stale SessionStart modules.

## [2.14.3] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **HOOK_RUNNER_TEST guard** — 6 Stop modules (chat-export, config-sync, drift-review, push-unpushed, self-reflection, session-brain-analysis) skip expensive operations when `HOOK_RUNNER_TEST=1` is set, preventing network/git/claude-p calls during test validation.
- **Per-module test timeout** — individual module load/call tests in `test-modules.sh` now have a 10s safety timeout.

### Fixed
- **drift-review.js** — added missing `// WORKFLOW: shtd` tag, fixed return type from bare string to `{text: status}` object.
- **self-reflection.js** — detached HEAD now returns `"HEAD"` instead of empty string.
- **Test suite timeout** — increased per-suite timeout from 120s to 360s for Windows CI stability.

## [2.14.2] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **workflow-summary.js** — defensive try/catch around `findWorkflows()`/`readState()` prevents crash when run outside a project context (fixes module validation test failure).
- **T114 test cleanup** — hardened YAML cleanup with `git show HEAD` fallback to prevent temp module name corruption in `no-local-docker.yml`.

### Changed
- **git branch detection** — `spec-gate.js`, `branch-pr-gate.js`, `enforcement-gate.js` now read `.git/HEAD` directly instead of spawning `git rev-parse` (faster on Windows, avoids timeout under CI load).
- **run-modules sync** — added 32 missing modules to `run-modules/` that existed in catalog but were never tracked.
- Removed unused `child_process` require from `spec-gate.js`, `branch-pr-gate.js`.

## [2.14.1] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Health check** — utility modules (like `reflection-score.js`) that export objects instead of functions no longer reported as failures. Health check now accepts both function and object exports.
- **`--test-module`** — utility modules skip invocation tests and display exported keys instead of crashing.
- **`reflection-score.js`** — now exports as a function with utility methods as properties, satisfying both the module contract and its role as a shared library.
- **ES5 consistency** — fixed remaining `.startsWith()`/`.endsWith()` calls in run-modules for ES5 compatibility.
- **`shtd.yml`** — added 2 missing modules (`session-cleanup`, `share-is-generic`) to workflow definition. Audit now 69/69.

## [2.14.0] — 2026-04-07

### Changed
- **spec-gate TODO.md fallback tightened** (T340) — on main branch in mature projects (with `specs/`), spec-gate now requires a feature branch instead of allowing blanket edits via any unchecked TODO task. Simple projects still use TODO.md directly.

### Added
- **Test suite** — `test-T340-todo-fallback.sh` (3 tests).

### Fixed
- **README** — added missing `no-rules-gate` module to documentation.

## [2.13.1] — 2026-04-07

### Fixed
- **Session isolation for hook state files** (T337) — temp flag files (`.claude-instruction-pending`, `.claude-turn-complete`, `.claude-bash-failures.json`, `.claude-self-analyze-cooldown`) now include `process.ppid` in filename. Different Claude Code tabs no longer interfere with each other's state.
- **Session cleanup module** — `session-cleanup.js` (SessionStart) sweeps orphaned flag files from crashed sessions by checking if the PID in the filename is still running.
- **Test suite** — `test-T337-session-isolation.sh` (8 tests: PID-scoped writes, cross-tab isolation, old-format ignored).

## [2.13.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **spec-gate Bash gating** (T338) — default-deny for Bash commands. Only allowlisted read-only commands (git, ls, cat, grep, etc.) pass without spec chain. Everything else requires spec → tasks → unchecked items.
- **Hook editing project lock** (T339) — only hook-runner project sessions can edit hook infrastructure. Other projects get hard block.
- **Bootstrap self-edit protection** (T339) — editing `hook-editing-gate.js` itself always blocked. Must be edited manually.
- **Static weakening detection** (T339) — flags modules claiming to enforce but never blocking, bare `return null` replacements.
- **Hook audit trail** (T339) — all edit attempts logged to `~/.system-monitor/hook-audit.jsonl`.
- **Test suites** — `test-T338-spec-gate-bash.sh`, `test-T339-hook-lock.sh`, expanded `test-T118` (10→14 tests).

## [2.12.0] — 2026-04-07

### Added
- **UserPromptSubmit module ban** (T341) — `hook-editing-gate` now blocks ALL UserPromptSubmit module creation. Any bug in a UPS module locks the user out with no recovery path. All detection/logging must live in PreToolUse/PostToolUse/Stop.
- **Frustration detection in UPS runner** (T346) — runner itself logs prompt previews to hook-log and detects frustration patterns (repeated phrases, escalation signals) → writes `frustration-log.jsonl`. No modules needed — runs in the runner process.
- **Constraint-rejection analysis** (T343) — self-reflection prompt now asks "did Claude declare a requirement impossible?" to catch premature surrender.
- **Wrong-tool-for-intent analysis** (T343) — self-reflection prompt checks if tool usage matched user's stated intent (e.g. grep local files when user said "research").
- **Frustration scoring** (T344) — `FRUSTRATION_DETECTED` (-15) and `RAPID_INTERRUPT_CLUSTER` (-20) penalties in reflection-score from frustration-log.jsonl events.

### Fixed
- **Self-reflection hasEdits guard removed** (T342) — sessions with user frustration but no file edits were completely skipped. The worst sessions (all talk, no action) now get reflected on.
- **No-edit session handling** (T347) — `buildPrompt()` shows "NO FILES EDITED" warning so `claude -p` analysis flags unproductive sessions.

### Removed
- **frustration-detector.js** (T345) — archived. UPS module approach was fundamentally flawed (blocking user prompts). Frustration detection moved to runner level.

## [2.11.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Session summary compaction** (`reflection-sessions.jsonl`) — one-line JSON summary after each reflection (files edited, issues found, score delta). Last 3 summaries injected into `claude -p` prompt for cross-session awareness. Interim short-term memory until brain integration (T331).
- **Reflection-gate scope enforcement** (T330) — replaced broad `/hooks/` allow with specific hook-runner module paths. Self-reflection can self-repair its own modules (`run-modules/`, `hook-runner/modules/`, runners, workflow files) but delegates everything else via TODOs.
- **Self-Reflection Architecture section** in CLAUDE.md — documents interim (direct `claude -p`) vs target (brain plugin) architecture.

### Fixed
- **DRY self-reflection** — `callClaude()` returns `{raw, parsed}`, removing duplicate `parseResponse()` call.
- **Cost optimization** — skip `claude -p` when no Edit/Write in recent hook-log entries (read-only/Bash-only stops).
- **Nested-claude gate FP** — `no-nested-claude.js` now skips `git`/`gh_auto` commands (path strings containing "claude" triggered false positives).

## [2.10.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Gamified reflection scoring** (`reflection-score.js`) — points for clean reflections (+10), autonomous stretches (+3/10 tool calls), TODO follow-through (+5). Penalties for user corrections (-5), dismissed improvements (-3), workflow violations (-10). Levels: Novice → Apprentice → Journeyman → Expert → Master.
- **Intervention tracking** — analyzes hook-log for user correction patterns ("no", "stop", "wrong"), interrupts, and autonomous stretches. The ultimate autonomy metric: how much user time are you saving vs wasting?
- **Full claude -p audit logging** (`reflection-claude-log.jsonl`) — every Stop runs LLM analysis. All prompts, raw responses, parsed results, and timing logged for audit and tuning.
- **Score injection at SessionStart** (`reflection-score-inject.js`) — every new session sees its score, level, streak, and the WHY behind the system.
- **Self-reflection prompt improvements** — now checks for dismissed improvements ("good enough for now") and missed TODOs. Auto-writes discovered TODOs to TODO.md.
- **Motivation loop** — the WHY is baked into the score file: "This score measures how well you protect the user's time."

### Fixed
- **Reflection-gate loophole** — removed `self-reflection.jsonl` from allow list. Claude can no longer edit the reflection log to unblock itself.
- **Self-reflection always runs** — removed rate limiting from claude -p calls. Every Stop is a checkpoint.

## [2.9.0] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **Self-reflection system** — LLM-powered introspection for hook-runner itself. `self-reflection.js` (Stop, async) calls `claude -p` to review recent gate decisions, checking if edits were appropriate for the current branch/task context. `reflection-gate.js` (PreToolUse) blocks production code edits if unresolved high/medium severity issues exist. Together they form a feedback loop: hooks watch Claude → self-reflection watches hooks → reflection-gate enforces corrections.
- **Spec-gate task ID enforcement (T321)** — if branch name contains TXXX pattern, verifies that specific task is unchecked in TODO.md or specs/*/tasks.md. Previously only checked that *any* task existed, allowing edits for unrelated tasks.
- **Cross-project guidance (T322)** — all spec-gate block messages now include instructions for cross-project workflow (write TODOs in other project → context_reset.py → resume).
- **"Spec before code" reminder (T323)** — all spec-gate block messages explicitly say "Write the spec FIRST, then create tasks, then code."
- **cross-project-todo-gate** — new PreToolUse module, blocks writing cross-project TODO items into local TODO.md.
- **no-adhoc-commands** — synced from live with Azure/terraform/azcopy/RDP blocks.

### Fixed
- **cross-project-todo-gate** — replaced hardcoded project prefixes (`_grobomo/`, `_tmemu/`) with dynamic directory discovery under PROJECTS_ROOT.

## [2.8.2] — 2026-04-06

### Added
- **`--analyze --deep`** — runs LLM analysis via `claude -p` (5 min timeout) for deeper semantic insights (coverage gaps, DRY overlap, consolidation recommendations). Saves prompt to `~/.claude/reports/analysis-prompt.txt` for manual re-run.
- **`--analyze --input <file>`** — loads pre-computed LLM analysis JSON and merges with local heuristics. LLM takes priority for qualitative categories; performance entries are merged.

### Fixed
- **Operator precedence bug in healthCheck** — `!subFiles[si].slice(-3) === ".js"` always evaluated to `false`. Fixed to `subFiles[si].slice(-3) !== ".js"`. Project-scoped modules in subdirs were silently skipped during health validation.
- **ES5 consistency** — replaced remaining `.endsWith()`/`.startsWith()` in setup.js (14), workflow.js (7), workflow-cli.js (8) with `.slice()`/`.indexOf()`/`.charAt()`

## [2.8.1] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **load-modules.js** — replaced 2 remaining `.endsWith()` ES6 calls with `indexOf()` for ES5 consistency

## [2.8.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **`--analyze` flag** for `--report` — generates a System Analysis section with quality score, coverage gaps, DRY issues, performance observations, redundancy detection, and recommendations. Uses heuristic rules (no external LLM dependency).
- **force-push-gate** (PreToolUse) — blocks `git push --force` to main/master. Force-pushing destroys shared history with no undo.
- **crlf-detector** (PostToolUse) — warns when Write/Edit produces CRLF line endings in shell scripts, YAML, Python, and other Unix-sensitive files.
- **git-destructive-guard** (PreToolUse) — blocks `git reset --hard`, `git checkout .`, `git clean -f` without diagnosis.
- **config-sync** (Stop) — auto-commits and pushes ~/.claude changes to cloud backup at session end.

### Performance
- **Merged hook-integrity-check into hook-integrity-monitor** — eliminated ~378ms from SessionStart. The UserPromptSubmit monitor now does a full scan on first invocation (or every hour), then spot-checks between.
- **Debounced config-sync** — skips if last successful sync was <1 hour ago. Cuts SessionStart from ~4093ms to ~400ms on subsequent sessions within the same hour.

### Fixed
- **4 test suites fixed** — T094 (module docs), T097 (workflow modules), T101 (workflow CLI), T104 (workflow summary) all referenced `code-quality` workflow consolidated into `shtd` in T313. Tests now use correct workflow names.
- **T094/T097 `find` hangs on Windows** — replaced `find` with `node` for module enumeration. Git Bash `find` is extremely slow on Windows.
- **Analysis spike detection** — raised threshold from 30x to 50x ratio and added 500ms floor to reduce noise from normal git cold-call spikes.
- **Analysis redundancy threshold** — raised from 1000 to 2000 calls with "(may be preventive)" qualifier for gates that succeed because users learned the rules.
- **Duplicate WHY detection** — now shows event/module path (e.g. `SessionStart/config-sync and Stop/config-sync`) instead of ambiguous bare names.
- **README module table** — added `crlf-detector`, `force-push-gate`, `git-destructive-guard`, `config-sync` (Stop).

### Removed
- **gsd-gate** — archived from live hooks. Fully superseded by test-checkpoint-gate.
- **hook-integrity-check** (SessionStart) — merged into hook-integrity-monitor (UserPromptSubmit).
- **test-tmp-mod-200506** — test artifact archived from catalog.

## [2.7.1] — 2026-04-05

### Performance
- **config-sync moved from SessionStart to Stop** — cuts SessionStart overhead from ~4093ms to ~776ms (81% reduction). Config sync runs at session end instead of start, where the 3-7s git push latency isn't blocking the user.

### Fixed
- **CHANGELOG duplicate** — report expand/collapse fix was listed in both 2.7.0 and 2.6.4; removed duplicate from 2.6.4.
- **backup-check** — removed "async example" language; this is a production module, not a demo.

## [2.7.0] — 2026-04-05

### Changed
- **Workflow consolidation** — merged 6 active workflows (code-quality, infra-safety, messaging-safety, self-improvement, session-management) into **shtd**. Down from 11 workflows to 5 (2 active: shtd + customer-data-guard, 3 dormant). shtd now has 58 modules covering the entire dev workflow: spec→PR pipeline, code quality, infrastructure safety, messaging guards, session lifecycle, and self-improvement.

### Fixed
- **Report expand/collapse** — `toggleModule` used `nextElementSibling` which pointed to `.module-why` instead of `.module-detail` when WHY text was present. Now uses `parentElement.querySelector(".module-detail")`.

### Added
- **`--analyze` command** — generates report with LLM-powered analysis (quality score, coverage gaps, DRY issues, performance observations, recommendations). Uses `claude -p` when run from terminal; gracefully skips when unavailable.
- **scripts/archive-live-workflows.sh** — reusable script to archive stale workflow YAMLs from live hooks dir

## [2.6.4] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **hook-integrity-monitor rate limiter** — in-memory `_lastCheckTime` was always 0 (each hook invocation is a fresh Node process). Replaced with file-based timestamp in `~/.claude/hooks/.integrity-last-check`. Saves ~85ms per prompt when rate-limited.

## [2.6.3] — 2026-04-05

### Improved
- **PreToolUse runner** — shared `input._git.tracking` alongside branch context; `remote-tracking-gate` no longer spawns its own `git config` call (~33ms savings per Edit/Write on feature branches)

## [2.6.2] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **spec-gate performance** — use shared `input._git.branch` from runner instead of spawning redundant `git rev-parse` (~45ms savings per Edit/Write) (#184)
- **T105 test** — read VERSION from package.json at runtime instead of broken sed pattern (#183)
- **T204 test** — remove path pattern in code comment that triggered portable-paths detection (#183)

### Added
- **Marketplace sync** — v2.6.1 → claude-code-skills

## [2.6.1] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- **Project dir decoding** — `--integrity` CLI now correctly resolves hyphenated names (`hook-runner`), dot-prefix dirs (`.claude`), and nested paths using greedy filesystem-aware decode (#180)

### Added
- **Decode tests** — `--integrity --json` validation and `decodeProjectDir` path resolution tests (#181)

## [2.6.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Hook integrity monitor** — 3 new modules that enforce hook system integrity across all Claude sessions (#176)
  - `workflow-compliance-gate` (PreToolUse): blocks if globally enforced workflow disabled at project level. Caught ddei session running ad-hoc without SHTD.
  - `hook-integrity-check` (SessionStart): verifies live modules match repo checksums, auto-repairs drift, reports workflow compliance status
  - `hook-integrity-monitor` (UserPromptSubmit, async): spot-checks random sample of modules each prompt, rate-limited 60s, full repair on drift
- **Repo marker file** — `sync-live` writes `.hook-runner-repo` to hooks dir so integrity modules can find source of truth
- **Exception whitelist** — manual `workflow-exceptions.json` for projects that legitimately need different workflow config
- **Test suite** — 18 tests for integrity monitor components (#176)

### Fixed
- Spec-gate test: added missing `spec.md` + initial git commit to temp repo (#173)
- README module docs: added 3 ep-incident-response modules to table (#173)

## [2.5.10] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **customer-data-guard workflow** — read-only incident response with 3 project-scoped modules (no-customer-env-changes, no-data-exfil, v1-read-only) (#170)

### Fixed
- **Workflow audit** now scans project-scoped subdirectories, not just top-level modules (#170)
- **Catalog sync** — spec-gate (branch-aware matching, auto-SHTD activation) and test-checkpoint-gate (tighter allowlist) synced from live (#170)

## [2.5.9] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- **Report: Workflow summary** — clickable cards showing each workflow and its modules, with block counts (#168)
- **Report: Workflow filter** — toolbar buttons to filter all modules by workflow name (#168)
- **Report: Workflow badge** — colored badge on each module card showing its workflow (#168)
- **Report: WHY text** — incident description shown prominently below module name, no longer buried in source (#168)

## [2.5.8] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- Replace `.startsWith()` and `.endsWith()` ES6 methods with `indexOf()` in 9 module files for ES5 consistency (#166)

## [2.5.7] — 2026-04-05

### Performance
- `preserve-iterated-content` module: use `git rev-list --count` instead of `git log --oneline` (faster, no output parsing), reduce timeout from 3s to 1.5s

### Fixed
- `preserve-iterated-content`: replace `.some()` ES6 method with for-loop for ES5 consistency
- `rule-hygiene`: replace `.includes()` ES6 method with `indexOf()` for ES5 consistency

## [2.5.6] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- `terminal-title` SessionStart module — sets terminal title to project folder name for multi-tab disambiguation (#162)

- `--uninstall` now removes `report.js` (was orphaned after uninstall) (#152)
- Added `constants.js` to `package.json` files array (fixed broken `npx` install) (#152)

### Improved
- DRY: extracted `RUNNER_FILES` to `constants.js` shared by `setup.js` and `workflow-cli.js` (#151)

## [2.5.2] — 2026-04-05

### Improved
- Added WORKFLOW/WHY header checks to module validation tests (#147, #148)
- Module tests now traverse project-scoped subdirectories (test count: ~100 → 244)

## [2.5.1] — 2026-04-05

### Fixed
- `--uninstall` now removes `workflow.js` and `workflow-cli.js` (were installed but not cleaned up) (#144)

### Improved
- DRY: shared `RUNNER_FILES` constant eliminates 3 divergent file lists in install/upgrade/uninstall (#145)

## [2.5.0] — 2026-04-05

### Improved
- Shared git context in PreToolUse runner — one `git rev-parse` call shared across 4 modules instead of each spawning independently (~80ms savings per tool call) (#140)
- `--workflow sync-live` now copies core files (runners, loader, logger) and project-scoped module subdirectories (#142)
  - File count: 66 → 78. Runner changes are now deployed automatically.

## [2.4.2] — 2026-04-05

### Improved
- `--perf` labels removed/archived modules with `[removed]` and excludes them from overhead estimates (#138)

### Fixed
- Remove unused `hasAsync` variable from run-async.js (#138)

## [2.4.1] — 2026-04-05

### Improved
- branch-pr-gate: defer `getBranch()` git subprocess until after state-change check — saves ~150ms for non-state-changing Bash commands (#136)

### Added
- Test suite for `--test-module` command (9 tests covering usage, errors, all event types, custom input) (#136)

## [2.4.0] — 2026-04-05

### Added
- `--test-module <path>` command — test a single module with sample inputs, supports `--input <json>` for custom test data (#134)

### Fixed
- Workflow YAML/tag mismatches: dispatcher-worker 9→1, cross-project-reset 0→1, shtd 17→16 (#133)
